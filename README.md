# Website-Automation-Testing-
It is a website automation testing using Cypress for the automation tools. I tested a dummy website for a feature called Edit Address. You can see the dummy website at https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/

How To Run The Script: 
1. Change Username and Address in cy.login('email','password') from e2e/web-auto-test-login/EditAddress.cy.js
2. Open the terminal in VSCode, run 'npx cypress run'
3. Choose file e2e/web-auto-test-login/EditAddress
